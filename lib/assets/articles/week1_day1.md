# Dim the Day, Prepare for Night

## Tips:

### Dim lights 30 minutes before bed
**Why:** Bright light delays melatonin, your natural sleep hormone. Lower lighting cues your body to shift into wind-down mode.

### Use warm-toned lighting
**Why:** Warm hues mimic sunset tones and reduce cognitive stimulation, preparing your brain for rest.

### Power down screens early
**Why:** Screens emit blue light, which tricks your brain into thinking it's daytime and suppresses melatonin.

### Set a "wind-down" alarm
**Why:** A simple reminder builds consistency and helps cue your body clock every evening.
